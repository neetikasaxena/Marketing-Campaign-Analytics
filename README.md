## Targeted-Marketing-Campaign
In target marketing campaigns analysis we identifies an audience likely to buy services or products and promotes those services or products to that audience. Once these key groups are recognized, companies develop marketing campaigns and specific products for those preferred market segments.

### Goal & Approach Taken
The purpose of this project is to train a predictive model that allows the company to maximize the profit of the next marketing campaign. The implementation involves prediction using Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm(specially Clustering Algorithm based on centroids namely K-Mean Clustering) and building different predictive models and later calculating its model accuracy using confusion metrics. This project implementation even involves relevant insights sharing in the form of docstrings. This is accomplished through Jupyter Notebook and Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### Dataset
Here analyzed “Marketing Campaign dataset” which is publicly available on Kaggle. This dataset describes customer response over 5 campaign. If the customer accepted the offer in the campaign, the target variable ‘y’ is marked as 1 else 0. There are 29 columns and 2240 rows in the dataset.
